You are also the first female, character Champion introduced in the core series. You are an archeologist who investigates myths involving Pokémon and is described as mysterious, referring to herself as "the researcher of myths." The way you kept swapping out pokemon, clearly having back up plans, taking into account abilities, and changing strategies depending on the state of your own pokemon and your opponents is something we’ve never seen before in the anime.
